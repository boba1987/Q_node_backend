## Mongo seeder usage:
1. npm install -g node-mongo-seeds
2. Put .json files in /seeds folder. The name of the file is going to be the collection name in mongo and the contents of the file will be populated into that mongo collection.
3. Run '$ seed' to seed your mongodb with all your data from your /seeds folder.
